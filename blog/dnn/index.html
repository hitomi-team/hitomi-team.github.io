We absolutely reject the notion that a user can implicitly consent to a service&rsquo;s privacy policy by simply just using it even when they are not shown the service&rsquo;s privacy policy. The data that is being collected without users&rsquo; explicit consent is highly sensitive and highly personal as NQN records <strong>User ID, User name & Discriminator, and the content of messages.</strong> Even though this is being done in the event of internal errors, this practice is <strong>absolutely unacceptable</strong> to us.</p><h2 id=okay-now-whats-the-solution>Okay, now what&rsquo;s the Solution?<a href=#okay-now-whats-the-solution class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor>&#8983;</a></h2><p>We are developing a NQN alternative called <strong>DNN (Definitely Not Nitro)</strong> that aims to be transparent, open source, and privacy respecting for everyone. The <a href=/privacy>privacy policy</a> for our alternative basically states that absolutely no information about the user is being collected.</p><p>You can help us out with our development by joining our <a href=https://discord.gg/Sx6Spmsgx7>Discord server</a> or contributing to the <a href=https://github.com/hitomi-team/DNN>main repository!</a> We gladly welcome all sorts of help as we are short handed on the development efforts for DNN.</p><ul><li><a href="https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=972542466861465620&permissions=536871936&scope=bot">Bot Invite Link</a></li><li><a href=https://discord.gg/Sx6Spmsgx7>Our Discord Server</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2022 Lorelei Labs, Inc.</span>
