&lt;h2 id="tldr">TL;DR:&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The developers for Not Quite Nitro have a very misleading privacy policy that admits that their bot, Not Quite Nitro, stores sensitive information about users in the case of internal errors on their end without the user&amp;rsquo;s knowledge. &lt;strong>We did not like their policy or practices, so we decided to make an open-source alternative.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://i.imgur.com/7oJLLst.png" alt="An example of the devs&amp;amp;rsquo; views on user privacy.">&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-the-problem">What&amp;rsquo;s the Problem?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We have a &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/Sx6Spmsgx7">Discord server&lt;/a> where user privacy is sacred. We absolutely reject the notion that a user can implicitly consent to a service&amp;rsquo;s privacy policy by simply just using it even when they are not shown the service&amp;rsquo;s privacy policy. The data that is being collected without users&amp;rsquo; explicit consent is highly sensitive and highly personal as NQN records &lt;strong>User ID, User name &amp;amp; Discriminator, and the content of messages.&lt;/strong> Even though this is being done in the event of internal errors, this practice is &lt;strong>absolutely unacceptable&lt;/strong> to us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="okay-now-whats-the-solution">Okay, now what&amp;rsquo;s the Solution?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are developing a NQN alternative called &lt;strong>DNN (Definitely Not Nitro)&lt;/strong> that aims to be transparent, open source, and privacy respecting for everyone. The &lt;a href="https://hitomi-team.github.io/privacy">privacy policy&lt;/a> for our alternative basically states that absolutely no information about the user is being collected.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can help us out with our development by joining our &lt;a href="https://discord.gg/Sx6Spmsgx7">Discord server&lt;/a> or contributing to the &lt;a href="https://github.com/hitomi-team/DNN">main repository!&lt;/a> We gladly welcome all sorts of help as we are short handed on the development efforts for DNN.&lt;/p>
